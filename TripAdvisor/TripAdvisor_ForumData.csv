Does (s)he know the property and the area? For example, does (s)he know if there is a supermarket or pub in the area? Is (s)he friendly and happy to engage with you, or is (s)he evasive and vague?

Fraud artists rarely (if ever) have access to a credit card machine."", u'DON\u2019T look for holiday lets on free listings sites like Craigslist or Gumtree. As they are wholly unregulated, 95% of the rentals offered for London are from scammers. Moreover, they give you false ideas of London neighbourhood market rates.']"
